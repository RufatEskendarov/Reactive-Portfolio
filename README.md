## Description

My new portfolio writen on ReactJS. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This work was done for the practical application of the skills acquired during the course on React JS. It is also intended to use this web application as a porthole during the job search.

## Aims

- GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- WHEN I load the portfolio
  THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
- WHEN I view the header
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- WHEN I view the navigation titles
  THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
- WHEN I click on a navigation title
  THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
- WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
  THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
- WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
  THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
- WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
  THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository
- WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
  THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
- WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
  THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
- WHEN I enter text into the email address field
  THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
- WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
  THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
- WHEN I view the footer
  THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
